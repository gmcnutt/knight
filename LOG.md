Added a basic walk-cycle animation based on the phaser 3 tutorial from
their main site. The animation was copied by hand from page 25 of
*Animation by Preston Blair*.

Added a ground sprite. The player appears to be walking a few pixels
above it because there are some grass blades sticking up, and the
player walks on the upper ground image border. The ground should be
flat, then, and any grass or vegetation should be on a background
sprite.
